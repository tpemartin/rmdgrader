# Part I: Programming Question (Full mark is 30)
One big question with 5 small questions. Each is worth 6 points. 

## Before you start

Each question is framed like:

Create an object named **practice** and bind a numeric value of 5 to it.
```{r ans0}
# practice
```

  * **All program lines must be inside a corresponding code chunk with code chunk label `ansXX`, like the one `ans0` above**. (程式碼請寫在每小題如上帶有`ansXX`標籤的code chunk裡)
  
  * **Keep `# practice` at the very last line inside your code chunk. You can remove # if you want, but it must be the last line**. (code chunk的最後一行請保留為`# xxx`，即原始code chunk所附帶的`# xxx`)
  
  * **To check whether your answer is correct, we will run the lines in that code chunk, then do a name call on the very-last-line object (i.e. practice here)** (so you better do a name call in console on the very-last-line name to see if it delivers the answer value you want.) (`# xxx`中的xxx是最後答案正確與否的依據，所以完成該小題你最好執行xxx的name call來檢查你的答案值。)
  
  * **DO NOT touch the code chunk label (i.e. ans_practice here).** Computer will fail to run your codes if you touch and change it.(code chunk一開頭的`ans_xxx`為code chunk label, 請不要動到它，否則會造成考卷判讀錯誤。)

## The Question

# 1 Econ Survey

An online survey is distributed to students of Economics department. 

## 1.1 Storing questions

There are two questions:

  * question 1: "Are you happy with our campus? Choose a number from 5(very happy), 4(happy), 3(satisfy), 2( unhappy), to 1(very unhappy)." 
  
  * question 2: "Did you participate in any of the following activities? Check all that apply to you. (student association, school club, school sport team, department sport team)"

Suppose the following retrieval will print each question respectively: 
```{r}
survey$questions[[1]] # will show as
"Are you happy with our campus? Choose a number from 5(very happy), 4(happy), 3(satisfy), 2( unhappy), to 1(very unhappy)."
survey$options[[1]] # will show as
c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

survey$questions[[2]] # will show as
"Did you participate in any of the following activities? Check all that apply to you. (student association, school club, school sport team, department sport team)"
survey$options[[2]] # will show as
c("student association", "school club", "school sport team", "department sport team")
```

Construct the `survey` object that can satisfy the above retrieval outcomes:
```{r ans11}
# declare then add method
survey <- list() # declare
survey$questions[[1]] <- "Are you happy with our campus? Choose a number from 5(very happy), 4(happy), 3(satisfy), 2( unhappy), to 1(very unhappy)." # then-add
survey$options[[1]] <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

survey$questions[[2]] <- "Did you participate in any of the following activities? Check all that apply to you. (student association, school club, school sport team, department sport team)"
survey$options[[2]] <- c("student association", "school club", "school sport team", "department sport team")

# survey
```
